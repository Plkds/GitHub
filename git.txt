<!--9 Facts-->
<ul>
<li>Elephants are pregnant for a whopping 22 months. Longer than any other animal. That’s nearly 2 years!</li>
<li> At birth, a baby elephants weigh 210 lbs (or 95kg).</li>
<li> African elephants are smaller at birth than Asian elephants but are much bigger as adults.
<li>The trunk is an incredibly useful, dexterous and clever appendage. It is able to sense the size, shape and temperature of an object.</li>
<li>Their trunks are pretty incredible and elephants have an amazing sense of smell, but their eyesight isn’t great.</li>
<li>To prove that point, elephants can smell water from 12 miles away!</li>
<li>That makes sense when you consider that they drink 210 litres of water a day.</li>
<li>Elephants spend up to 16 hours foraging every day</li>
<li> But only 2-3 hours are spent sleeping. That shows what their priorities are!</li>
